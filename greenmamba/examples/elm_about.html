<h2>The ELM resource</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://elm.eu.org/">Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource</a> is a database and prediction tool for investigating candidate functional sites in eukarytic proteins. Functional sites which fit to the description "linear motif" are currently specified as patterns using Regular Expression rules. To improve the predictive power, context-based rules and logical filters are being developed and applied to reduce the amount of false positives.</p>

<h2>Mamba and GreenMamba</h2>

<p>The resource you are currently viewing is a frozen mirror of ELM running under Mamba server using the GreenMamba tool and database module. The aim is not to host a mirror of ELM per se, but simply to illustrate how  one can setup web interfaces for bioinformatics tools and databases with an absolute mininum of work.</p>
