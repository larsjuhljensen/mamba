<h2>Download HOODS</h2>

<p>
If you want to use HOODS to perform large-scale analyses, we recommend that you download the command-line version of the program and run it locally on your own computer. HOODS is implemented in Perl and relies on no modules or external programs.
</p>

<p>
To run HOODS, execute the following command:
</p>

<pre>
./hoods.pl &lt;matrix file&gt; &lt;label file&gt; [alpha]
</pre>

<p>
The first argument is the name of file containing a similarity matrix; this file has three columns, namely entity1, entity2, and similarity. The second argument is the name of a label file with two columns, namely entity and association score. The third optional argument is the value for alpha, which defaults to 0.5.
</p>

<p>
The script produces a tab-separated file with all the neighborhoods ranked by their neighborhood score. Each line in the file lists the score of a neighborhood, the number of entities in the neighborhood, and a list of all of them.
