<p class="footer_description">The disease associations are derived via automatic text mining of the biomedical literature and have not been manually verified. The confidence of each association is signified by stars, where <span class="stars">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9734;</span> is the highest confidence and <span class="stars">&#9733;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;&#9734;</span> is the lowest.</p>
<p class="footer_description">Each disease&ndash;gene association is based on a text-mining score, which is proportional to 1) the absolute number of comentionings and 2) the ratio of observed to expected comentionings (i.e. the enrichment). These scores are normalized to z-scores by comparing them to a random background. This is represented by stars, each star corresponding to two standard deviations above the mean of the background distribution.</p>
